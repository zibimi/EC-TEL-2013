Project
=======
This is the iOS project we have done for PawsLab in Science School University of Pittsburgh about the iOS interface of Conference Navigator

During the summer of 2013, we first launched the iOS 6 version of this app for EC-TEL 2013. Which was published onto AppStore:

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ec-tel-2013/id694446202?mt=8

After the success of this application, the Apple release the brand new iOS 7, due to our graduation is coming and we thought that to convert the app to adapte iOS 7 would be a great last call for our independent study group, so here it is, the basic program for Conference Navigator, hope the student later get involve in this program would found it a good start and keep improve it.

good luck and may the force be with you!
